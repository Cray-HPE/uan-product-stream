# UAN Ansible Roles

## `uan_disk_config`

The `uan_disk_config` role configures swap and scratch disk partitions on UAN
nodes.

### Requirements

There must be disk devices found on the UAN node by the `device_filter` module
or this role will exit with failure. This condition can be ignored by setting
`uan_require_disk` to `false`. See variable definitions below.

See the `library/device_filter.py` file for more information on this module.

The device that is found will be unmounted if mounted and a swap partition will
be created on the first half of the disk, and a scratch partition on the second
half. ext4 filesystems are created on each partition.

### Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

`uan_require_disk`

: Boolean to determine if this role continues to setup disk if no disks were found
by the device filter. Set to `true` to exit with error when no disks are found. 

  Example:

  ```yaml
  uan_require_disk: false
  ```

`uan_device_name_filter`

: Regular expression of disk device name for this role to filter.

: Filesystem location to mount the scratch partition.

  Example:

  ```yaml

  ```

`swap_file`

: Name of the swapfile to create. Full path is `<uan_swap>/<swapfile>`.

  ```

`swap_dd_command`

: `dd` command to create the `swapfile`.

### Dependencies

`library/device_filter.py` is required to find eligible disk devices.

### Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: Application_UAN
  roles:
      - { role: uan_disk_config }
```

This role is included in the UAN `site.yml` play.

## `uan_interfaces`

The `uan_interfaces` role configures site/customer-defined network interfaces
and Shasta Customer Access Network (CAN) network interfaces on UAN nodes.

### Requirements

None.

### Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

`uan_nmn_bond`

`uan_nmn_bond` is a boolean variable controlling the configuration of the Node Management Network (NMN).
When true, the NMN network connection will be configured as a bonded pair of interfaces defined by the members of the
`uan_nmn_bond_slaves` variable. The bonded NMN interface is named `nmnb0`. When false, the NMN network connection
will be configured as a single interface named `nmn0`.

The default value of `uan_nmn_bond` is `no`.

```yaml
uan_nmn_bond: no
```

`uan_nmn_bond_slaves`

`uan_nmn_bond_slaves` is a list of the interfaces to use as the bond slave pair when `uan_nmn_bond` is true.

The interface names must be in a format which doesn't change between reboots of the node, such as `ens10f0`
which is the first port of the NIC in slot 10.  

**NOTE:** `ens10f0` is typically the first port of the OCP 25Gb card that
the node PXE boots.

**IMPORTANT!** The first interface in the list must be the `nmn0` interface which is configured during the
initial image boot, typically `ens10f0`.  This is required because the MAC address of the `nmn0` interface
is the MAC associated with the IP address of the UAN.  The bonded `nmnb0` interface and the bond slaves
will assume this MAC and the IP address of `nmn0` to preserve connectivity.

The second interface is typically the first port of a different 25Gb NIC for resiliency.

The default values of `uan_nmn_bond_slaves` are shown here.  They may need to be changed to match the actual
node cabling and NIC configuration.
```yaml
uan_nmn_bond_slaves:
  - "ens10f0"
  - "ens1f0"
```

`uan_can_setup`

Boolean variable controlling the configuration of user
access to UAN nodes.  When true, user access is configured over either the
Customer Access Network (CAN) or Customer High Speed Network (CHN), depending on which is configured on the system.

When `uan_can_setup` is false, user access over the CAN or CHN is not configured
on the UAN nodes and no default route is configured.  The Admin must then specify
the default route in `customer_uan_routes`.

The default value of `uan_can_setup` is `no`.

```yaml
uan_can_setup: no
```

`uan_can_bond_slaves`

`uan_can_bond_slaves` is a list of the interfaces to use as the bond slave pair when `uan_can_setup` is true, `uan_nmn_bond` is true, and the Customer Access Network (CAN) is configured on the system.  This variable is ignored if `uan_nmn_bond` is false.

The interface names must be in a format which doesn't change between reboots of the node, such as `ens10f1`
which is the second port of the NIC in slot 10.  

**NOTE:** `ens10f1` is typically the second port of the OCP 25Gb card and is used as one of the bond
slaves in the CAN `bond0` interface.

The second interface is typically the second port of a different 25Gb NIC for resiliency.

The default values of `uan_can_bond_slaves` are shown here.  They may need to be changed to match the actual
node cabling and NIC configuration.

```yaml
uan_can_bond_slaves:
  - "ens10f1"
  - "ens1f1"
```

`uan_customer_default_route` is a boolean variable that allows the default route
to be set by the `customer_uan_routes` data when `uan_can_setup` is true.

By default, no default route is setup unless `uan_can_setup` is true, which sets the default route to the CAN or CHN.

```yaml
uan_customer_default_route: no
```

`sls_nmn_name`

: `sls_nmn_name` is the Node Management Network name used by SLS.
This value should not be changed.

`sls_nmn_svcs_name`

: is the Node Management Services Network name used by SLS.
This value should not be changed.

`uan_required_dns_options`

: `uan_required_dns_options` is a list of DNS options.  By default, `single-request` is set and must not be removed.

          - "from 10.1.0.0/16 lookup 1"
      - name: "net2"
        rules:
