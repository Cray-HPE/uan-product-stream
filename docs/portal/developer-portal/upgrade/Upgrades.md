# Upgrades

Performing an upgrade of UAN from one version to the next follows the same general process as a fresh install. Some considerations may need to be made when merging the existing CFS configuration with the latest CFS configuration provided by the release.

The overall workflow for completing a UAN upgrade involves:

1. Perform the [UAN Installation](../install/Install_the_UAN_Product_Stream.md) 

2. Review any [Notable Changes](Notable_Changes.md)

3. [Merge UAN CFS Configuration Data](Merge_UAN_Configuration_Data.md)

4. [Create UAN images and reboot](../operations/Create_UAN_Boot_Images.md)
